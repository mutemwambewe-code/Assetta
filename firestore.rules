/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PropEase Zambia.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data stored
 * under the `/users/{userId}` collection. Only the authenticated user
 * matching the `userId` path segment has read and write access to their
 * own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data (properties, tenants, message logs, and templates)
 * are nested under the `/users/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data; listing other users' data is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during the prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules rely on the `request.auth.uid` to match the `{userId}` path segment
 * to enforce ownership. No additional data denormalization is required.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All private user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring
 * clear separation from any potentially public data (not present in this model).
